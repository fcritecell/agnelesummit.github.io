				<b>GAMEPLAY:</b>
					<li><b>Each business card represents a specific company within a sector.It includes all the information required for investing in that business. Players start by choosing a sector (e.g., technology, healthcare) and acquiring their first business. They take turns moving around the board, investing in or acquiring businesses in their chosen sector. Strategic decisions are made based on market trends, competitor actions, and random events. They can choose to diversify their portfolio by investing in multiple sectors or focus on dominating a single sector. They can acquire competitors' businesses, merge with others, and face random economic events via "Chance Cards." The game ends when a player monopolizes a sector or reaches a wealth goal. The player with the highest net worth at the end of the game is declared the winner.
