                <b>Description:</b> The World Trade Organization Model United Nations (WTO MUN) is a simulation of the
                activities and decision-making processes of the World Trade Organization (WTO), conducted within the
                framework of a Model United Nations conference. Participants take on the roles of diplomats representing
                various member states of the WTO, as well as non-governmental organizations, intergovernmental
                organizations, and other stakeholders.
